## Introduction

> _This README file is in Markdown format, and is meant to provide a template for README files as well an illustration of what the README file can be expected to look like.  For software, this [Introduction](#introduction) section &ndash; which you are presently reading &ndash; should provide background for the program, a brief explanation of what the project is about, and optionally, pointers to resources that can help orient readers.  Ideally, this section should be short._


## Installation

> _Begin this section by mentioning any prerequisites that may be important for users to have before they can use your software.  Examples include hardware and operating system requirements._
>
> _Next, provide step-by-step instructions for installing the software, preferably with command examples that can be copy-pasted by readers into their software environments._
>
> _Sometimes, subsections may be needed for different operating systems or particularly complicated installations._
 

## Usage

> _This [Usage](#usage) section would explain more about how to run the software, what kind of behavior to expect, and so on._
>
> _Begin with the simplest possible example of how to use your software.  Provide example command lines and/or screen images, as appropriate, to help readers understand how the software is expected to be used.  Many readers are likely to look for command lines they can copy-paste directly from your explanations, so it's best to keep that in mind as you write examples._
>
> _Some programs are complicated and users can benefit from additional sections in the README file.  It's difficult to give specific instructions &ndash; a lot depends on your software, your intended audience, etc.  Use your judgment and ask for feedback from users or colleagues to help figure out what else is worth explaining._


## Known issues and limitations

> _In this section, summarize any notable issues and/or limitations of your software.  If none are known yet, this section can be omitted (and don't forget to remove the corresponding entry in the [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents) too); alternatively, you can leave this section in and write something along the lines of "none are known at this time"._
